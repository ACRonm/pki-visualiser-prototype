# PKI Visualiser: Retrospective & Integration Guide

## Retrospective Summary

This section summarises the development process based on the initial `PLAN.md` and the steps taken.

**Initial Goal:** Create a Next.js App Router page using Reagraph and Tailwind CSS to visualise mock PKI hierarchies, allow structure selection, display node details, and export data.

**Key Decisions & Changes:**

1.  **Library Change (Reagraph -> React Flow):** Upon review, Reagraph appeared less maintained. We switched to the more active and feature-rich **React Flow** (now `@xyflow/react`) library. This required updating the plan and installation steps.
2.  **Project Setup:** Initial attempts to install dependencies and configure Tailwind in an existing structure faced issues (`npx` errors, missing config files). We reset by scaffolding a fresh Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript and Tailwind integrated.
3.  **Styling Approach (Tailwind -> Custom Node):** Applying Tailwind classes directly via node data (`className`) proved unreliable for consistent text contrast. We shifted to using a **React Flow Custom Node (`BaseCANode`)** to encapsulate styling logic directly within the node component, providing better control over background and text colours based on CA type.
4.  **(Removed Dark Mode Implementation details as not relevant for target integration)**
4.  **Layout Adjustments:** Replaced fixed height calculations with flexbox (`flex-grow`) to ensure the main visualisation area fills available space without unnecessary scrolling.
5.  **JSON Export:** Implemented the export functionality, initially using React Flow's internal keys (`nodes`, `edges`), then refining it to use more domain-specific keys (`certificateAuthorities`, `relationships`) suitable for a PKIaaS backend.
6.  **Minor Fixes:** Addressed hydration errors by adjusting `layout.tsx` formatting and resolved various TypeScript errors related to component props and state management.

**Challenges Encountered:**

*   Initial dependency installation and Tailwind setup issues.
*   TypeScript type inference complexities with React Flow props (`NodeProps`, `NodeTypes`).
*   Ensuring consistent styling and contrast, leading to the adoption of custom nodes.
*   Minor bugs like leftover code lines after refactoring.

**Final Features Implemented:**

*   React Flow visualisation of 4 mock PKI structures.
*   Structure selection via segmented buttons.
*   Sidebar displaying details of the selected node (using mock data).
*   Custom nodes with type-specific background/text colours.
*   **(Removed Theme Toggle feature as not relevant for target integration)**
*   JSON export of the current view using descriptive keys.
*   Responsive layout adjustments.

## Integration Guide (React + Vite + React-Bootstrap)

Integrating this Next.js/Tailwind prototype into an existing React/Vite app using React-Bootstrap requires adapting components and handling styling differences.

**1. Dependencies:**

Install the core visualisation library:

```bash
npm install @xyflow/react
# or
yarn add @xyflow/react
```

**2. Core Component Structure:**

You'll need to copy and adapt the following components into your Vite project structure (e.g., under `src/components/pkiVisualizer/`):

*   `PKIGraphClient.tsx` (and its wrapper `PKIGraphClientWrapper`) - Main logic.
*   `Sidebar.tsx` - Displays node details and export button.
*   `StructureSelector.tsx` - Buttons to switch views.
*   `CustomNodes/BaseCANode.tsx` - Renders the actual nodes.
*   **(Removed `ThemeToggle.tsx` as not relevant for target integration)**
*   `data/mockPkiData.ts` - Contains the mock graph data.
*   `types/pki.ts` - TypeScript definitions.

**3. Styling (React-Bootstrap Adaptation - Recommended):**

This is the most significant adaptation needed. Since your project uses React-Bootstrap, directly using the Tailwind utility classes from the prototype won't work without setting up Tailwind alongside React-Bootstrap (which can be complex and lead to conflicts).

**Recommendation:** Rewrite the components to use React-Bootstrap components and styling conventions.

*   **`BaseCANode.tsx`:**
    *   Replace the `div` with Tailwind classes with a React-Bootstrap component like `<Card>` or a styled `div`.
    *   Use `Card.Body`, `Card.Title`, `Card.Text`.
    *   Apply background colours using inline styles or custom CSS classes mapped to Bootstrap variables/themes if available. The logic in `getNodeBgColor` and `getNodeTextColor` needs to output appropriate styles or classes for your React-Bootstrap setup instead of Tailwind classes.
    *   Keep the React Flow `<Handle>` components.
*   **`Sidebar.tsx`:**
    *   Replace the `<aside>` and `div`s with React-Bootstrap components like `<Card>`, `<ListGroup>`, `<ListGroup.Item>`, `<Button>`.
    *   Use `className` props for spacing (`mb-3`, `p-2`, etc.) or `<Stack>` for layout.
    *   Adapt the conditional rendering logic.
*   **`StructureSelector.tsx`:**
    *   Replace the buttons with React-Bootstrap `<ButtonGroup>` and `<Button>` components. Use the `active` prop on the selected button.
*   **(Removed `ThemeToggle.tsx` adaptation details)**
*   **`PKIGraphClient.tsx`:**
    *   Remove the Tailwind `className` from the main `div` and `<ReactFlow>` component.
    *   Update the "Fit View" button to use React-Bootstrap `<Button>`.
    *   The `<Panel>` component might need custom styling or replacement if its default look clashes.
*   **`page.tsx` (Adaptation):**
    *   You won't have a `page.tsx`. Integrate `PKIGraphClientWrapper` into your existing React Router or page structure.
    *   Use React-Bootstrap layout components (`<Container>`, `<Row>`, `<Col>`) to create the desired two-column layout (graph on left, sidebar on right for larger screens).
*   **React Flow CSS:** You **still need** to import the base React Flow styles:
    ```javascript
    import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
    ```
    Import this in your main application entry point (e.g., `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`).

**4. Data & Types:**

*   Copy `types/pki.ts` and `data/mockPkiData.ts` into your project (e.g., `src/types/`, `src/data/`). Adjust import paths in the components accordingly.

**5. (Removed Theme Toggle Adaptation section)**
**5. JSON Export:**

*   The export logic in `Sidebar.tsx` uses standard browser APIs and should work fine. Ensure the `nodes` and `edges` props are correctly passed from `PKIGraphClient.tsx`. You can adjust the exported fields (`id`, `position`, `type`) as needed for your backend.

**6. Placement:**

*   Decide where the visualizer fits in your application flow. Import and render the `PKIGraphClientWrapper` component within the appropriate page or route component in your Vite/React-Bootstrap app. Use React-Bootstrap layout components to position it alongside other UI elements.

This guide provides a starting point. The main effort will be translating the Tailwind-based styling and layout into equivalent React-Bootstrap components and conventions.
